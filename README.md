**Catastrophe Pack** (working title)  
An exploration and building focused pack that expands on Vanilla game play instead of overhauling it. Wander the world as a nomad, or plant roots and build! *Catastrophe not included.*  

This is a **Fabric** mod pack that runs under Forge via **Jumploader**.  

**Features:**  
* More biomes!  
* More ambiance!  
* More building & decor blocks!  
* More foods!  
* Backpacks and bedrolls!  
* Ruins & treasures!  
* Improved vanilla structures!  
* Quality of life additions!  
* Minimap & world map!  

Started as a personal pack, Catastrophe Pack is very much a WIP.
